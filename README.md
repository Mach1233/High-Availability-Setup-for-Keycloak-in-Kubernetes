# 🚀 Enterprise High-Availability Keycloak Deployment on Kubernetes

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **production-ready, highly available Identity and Access Management (IAM) architecture** using cloud-native technologies.

The solution eliminates single points of failure, ensures distributed session consistency, and provides enterprise-grade scalability using Kubernetes-native principles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deploy **Keycloak in High Availability mode**
- Implement **Distributed Session Replication**
- Eliminate single points of failure
- Integrate an external persistent database
- Validate SSO integration with a real application
- Follow production-grade Kubernetes architecture

---

# 🏗️ 1. Global Infrastructure Architecture

## 📖 Architecture Summary

The infrastructure is composed of:

- 🔹 1 HAProxy Load Balancer
- 🔹 2 Kubernetes Master Nodes (HA Control Plane)
- 🔹 2 Kubernetes Worker Nodes
- 🔹 3 Keycloak Replicas
- 🔹 3 Infinispan Replicas
- 🔹 External PostgreSQL Database
- 🔹 Integrated Nextcloud Application

The entire system is orchestrated using **K3s (Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution)**.

# ☸️ 2. Kubernetes High Availability Design

## 🔧 Why K3s?

- Lightweight Kubernetes distribution
- Suitable for on-premise environments
- Fully CNCF compliant
- Reduced resource consumption
- Production capable

## 🏛️ Control Plane High Availability

The Kubernetes control plane is designed with:

- Multiple master nodes
- HAProxy load balancing the Kubernetes API
- External datastore configuration
- Worker nodes handling workloads

This design ensures:

- API server redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- Cluster resiliency

# 🔐 3. Identity Layer – Keycloak Cluster

## 📖 Overview

Keycloak is deployed in clustered mode with:

- Multiple replicas
- External PostgreSQL database
- Infinispan distributed cache
- Kubernetes Operator-based deployment

## 🔑 Features Implemented

- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- Realm & Client configuration
- Secure secret management
- Persistent storage

## ⚙️ High Availability Strategy

- Stateless Keycloak pods
- Distributed session replication via Infinispan
- Persistent data stored in PostgreSQL
- Load-balanced service exposure


# ⚡ 4. Distributed Caching Layer – Infinispan

## 📖 Purpose

Infinispan is used to provide:

- Distributed in-memory caching
- Session replication
- Reduced database load
- Horizontal scalability

## ❓ Why It Is Critical

Without Infinispan:
- Sessions would remain local to a single pod
- Users would be logged out if traffic shifts to another replica

With Infinispan:
- Sessions are replicated across the cluster
- Pods remain stateless
- Failover is seamless
- System resilience increases

# 🗄️ 5. Database Layer – PostgreSQL

## 📖 Role

PostgreSQL serves as the persistent storage backend for:

- Users
- Roles
- Clients
- Realms
- Tokens
- Configuration data

## 🛡️ Reliability Strategy

- External database deployment
- Persistent volume configuration
- Database credentials stored as Kubernetes Secrets
- Secure service communication

This guarantees:

- Data durability
- Backup capability
- Isolation from pod lifecycle

---

# 🌍 6. Application Integration – Nextcloud

To validate real-world authentication integration, **Nextcloud** was connected to Keycloak using:

- OpenID Connect
- Secure client credentials
- Role mapping configuration

This demonstrates:

- Enterprise SSO implementation
- Real production-ready IAM integration
- Centralized authentication across applications

---

# 🔁 7. Failover & Resilience Testing

The following validation tests were performed:

✅ Keycloak pod deletion test  
✅ Infinispan pod restart test  
✅ Master node shutdown simulation  
✅ Worker node failure simulation  
✅ Session persistence validation  
✅ Load balancing validation  

Results confirmed:

- No session loss
- Automatic pod rescheduling
- High availability maintained
- No authentication disruption
